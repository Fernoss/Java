# Java Assignments Repository

Welcome to my Java Assignments repository! Here, I share my code for Java assignments issued by Hamk school. As of November 17, 2022, I'm showcasing some of my most advanced projects.

## Featured Projects

### ToyAssignment
- Demonstrates the use of inheritance, encapsulation, and methods.

### CodeRunnerApp
- Utilizes user input effectively using a WHILE-loop.

### Calculation_Task
- Utilizes STATIC and `Math.PI` to perform calculations.

### PacmanTask
- Involves calling methods from another class.

## Learning Journey

I'm actively learning Object-Oriented programming and using IntelliJ as my text editor. It's worth noting that in these assignments, I've created classes in the same `Main.java` file, not as separate entities.
