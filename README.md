# Java
Printing here my code of Java assignments issued by Hamk school

My most advanced project as of now date: 16.11.2022

-> ToyAssignment, which has code use of inheritance, encapsulation, methods

-> CodeRunnerApp has code that utilizes user input effectively usin WHILE-loop


Learning Object-Oriented programming, using IntelliJ as text editor.

Note: In the assignments it is asked to create class on same Main.java file, not as separate.
This is the reason for only Main.java file.
